        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          The Waverley Design Company was established to provide cost-effective, quality, and community minded design and web development to the local area. We aim to help you deliver the very best experience to your visitors and customers, whether you’re a small local business, community organisation, or just an individual with a great idea. This could involve a beautiful website, an informative and useful web-app, or perhaps a set of stunning business cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in only providing the best service, so our websites are built to last - they’re constructed from modern frameworks that are currently setting the standard for the future of the web. That means no costly and time-consuming updates, saving you hassle and letting you get back to work.
